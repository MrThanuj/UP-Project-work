This project was done in 2021 using the Machine learning technique to detect fraud in the insurance company dataset. We are collecting the dataset, preprocessing it, and then fed it to the model building phase here we use SVM (Support Vector Machine) and XG Boost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Then we are performing a model evaluation to select the best prediction model.
In this project using this dataset we found XG Boost performing better than SVM. Best Model gave the expected output in terms of Fraud or Not Fraud.

Our project is deployed in cloud platform as API, using flask Web framework.
