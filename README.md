Insurance Fraud Detection using Machine Learning 

This is the University Project done in the year 2021 on subject Machine learning to detect the fraud in Insurance company dataset.
We are collecting the dataset, preprocessing it and then fed it to model building phase here we use SVM (Support Vector Machine)  and XG Boost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting).
Then we are performing Model evaluation to select the best model for prediction. 
In this project using this dataset we found XG Boost performing better than SVM. Best Model gave the expected output in terms of Fraud or Not Fraud.

Our project is deployed in cloud platform as API, using flask Web framework.
